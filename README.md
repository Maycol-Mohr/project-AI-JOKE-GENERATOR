# 🤖 AI Joke Generator (Python + Flask)

A simple and fun mini‑project built with **Python**, **Flask**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and a bit of **JavaScript**.  
The app generates a random joke based on any topic entered by the user — a small “generative AI–style” logic using template-based generation.

This project was created to practice:
- Building a small web app with Flask  
- Working with routes and JSON APIs  
- Connecting frontend (HTML/JS) with a Python backend  
- Basic generative logic using templates  
- Styling with modern CSS

---

## 🚀 Features
- Type any topic (e.g., *dogs, programming, coffee, Monday…*)  
- Backend generates a random joke using a template model  
- Clean and responsive interface  
- Instant API response using `fetch()`  
- Perfect starter project for learning Python + Flask

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- **Flask**
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (fetch API)**
